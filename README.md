# How to use
### Point 1 and 2 below only needs to be done for the first time.
1. Needs numpy installed. First download the prerequisite.bat file
2. While Maya is not running, run the bat file as administrator, this will install numpy to maya. (Needs active internet)
3. Download the py script and save it self or run it from the editor.
